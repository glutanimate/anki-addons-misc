# Credits

What follows is an overview of add-ons whose maintenance I took over after they were deleted from AnkiWeb.

All credit for the original add-ons goes to their respective authors.

### SteveAW

The following add-ons were forked from [steveaw/anki_addons](https://github.com/steveaw/anki_addons):

- reviewer_browse_creation
- reviewer_browse_today
- reviewer_hide_toolbar
- reviewer_more_answer-buttons
- reviewer_track_unseen

### nest0r / ja-dark

The original versions of the following add-ons were likely written by nest0r/ja-dark who [disappeared from the Anki scene](https://forum.koohii.com/thread-14570.html) in early 2017:

- reviewer_progress_bar
- reviewer_visual_feedback

--------------

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of the add-on authors above, both for their fantastic add-ons, and for what I have learned from studying their work.
