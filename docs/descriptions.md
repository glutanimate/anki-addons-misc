## browser_batch_edit: Batch Note Editing

Adds a new menu item to the card browser that allows you to:

- **batch-add** information/media to a specific field
- **batch-replace** the contents of a specific field

The changes will be applied to all selected notes that feature the selected field.

**DEMO**

Here's a quick demo video that showcases these features:

[![YouTube: Anki add-on demo: Batch Note Editing](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iCZzcSnAeH4/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iCZzcSnAeH4)

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**OTHER REMARKS**

The add-on uses the first selected note to generate the field list you're presented with. So please make sure to select a note with the right fields.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-23 – Initial 2.1 compatibility
2017-08-06 – Ability to insert text as HTML
2017-05-13 – Only insert line-breaks when necessary
2016-12-11 – Support for adding text before existing content (thanks to @luminousspice for the idea)
2016-12-08 – Initial release

## browser_create_duplicate: Duplicate Selected Notes

This add-on supplements the **card browser** by adding a keyboard shortcut and **menu** entry for **creating duplicates of notes**.

**USAGE**

Pressing the **shortcut** (`Ctrl+Alt+C` by default) or clicking on the *Create Duplicate* entry in the Edit menu will find all notes belonging to the selected cards and duplicate them in place.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- All cards generated by each note will be duplicated alongside the note
- All duplicated cards will end up in the deck of the first selected card
- The duplicated cards should look exactly like the originals
- Tags are preserved in the duplicated notes
- Review history is NOT duplicated to the new cards (they appear as new cards)
- The notes will be marked as duplicates (because they are!)

**CHANGES**

2017-08-23 – Initial 2.1 compatibility
2017-08-06 – Refactored code
2016-04-30 – Duplications can now be undone via CTRL+Z (using Anki's default restoration points)

------------------------------------------

## browser_search_hotkeys: Browser Search Hotkeys

Allows you to set up **hotkeys for searches** in the **browser**

**USAGE**

Hotkeys follow this scheme: Ctrl+S –> (Modifier) + Key. I.e.: hit Ctrl+S to start the key sequence, let go of Ctrl+S, then hit the key assigned to  your search, plus an optional modifier.

You can use keyboard modifiers to control whether to add a term to the  search, negate it, remove it, or do something else. This follows the same  logic as the default behaviour in Anki when clicking on a search term in the sidebar.

New hotkeys can be defined in the source file by editing the `search_shortcuts` dictionary. Make sure to follow the existing syntax.

For instance, line 2 in the default `search_shortcuts` dict assigns the search
'added 1' (cards added today) to 'T'. This defines the following key sequences
in the browser:

    Ctrl+S -> T             replace search field with 'added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+T        add 'added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Alt+T:        replace search field with '-added:1'
    Ctrl+S -> Ctrl+Alt+T:   add '-added:1' to existing search
    Ctrl+S -> Shift+T:      add 'or added:1' to existing search

The following keys are assigned by default:

    'A': {'search': ''},            # All together now
    'T': {'search': 'added:1'},     # Today
    'V': {'search': 'rated:1'},     # Viewed
    'G': {'search': 'rated:1:1'},   # aGain today
    'F': {'search': 'card:1'},      # First
    'C': {'search': 'deck:current'},# Current
    'N': {'search': 'is:new'},      # New
    'L': {'search': 'is:learn'},    # Learn
    'R': {'search': 'is:review'},   # Review
    'D': {'search': 'is:due'},      # Due
    'S': {'search': 'is:suspended'},# Suspended
    'B': {'search': 'is:buried'},   # Buried
    'M': {'search': 'tag:marked'},  # Marked
    'E': {'search': 'tag:leech'},   # lEech

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on has only been tested with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is probably **not supported** at this point in time.

**CHANGES**

2017-08-06 – Refactored code
2016-04-27 – Implemented hotkeys for more searches. Thanks to ankitest!

## editor_autocomplete_whitelist

This is a modified version of the [Editor Autocomplete add-on for Anki](https://github.com/sartak/editor-autocomplete). Instead of checking against a blacklist of non-autocompleted fields this implementation of the add-on will only enable autocomplete on fields you specify.

Fields to enable autocomplete on can be specified by modifying the `AutocompleteFields` array at the beginning of the script, e.g.:

```python
AutocompleteFields = [ "sources", "additional-info" ]
```

This version of the add-on also includes a hotkey that saves you the trouble of clicking on the autocomplete suggestion. It's set to <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> by default.

All credit for the original add-on goes to Shawn M Moore ([@sartak](https://github.com/sartak/)).


------------------------------------------

## editor_custom_stylesheet: Customize Editor Stylesheet

Allows you to customize the **stylesheet** of the **Editor widget** in Anki.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**USAGE**

Create an `_editor.css` file in your media collection, add your custom CSS rules to it, and restart Anki. Use the css class `.field` to format all fields in the Editor widget. The addon can be switched on and off in the main window via Tools - "Custom Editor Styling" (hotkey Shift+E in the Deck View). After changing this setting, reopen all Browser and Add windows.

Compatibility with the addon [Night Mode](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067) (Version 2017-03-06): By default this addon is disabled when the Night Mode is activated.

Compatibility with the addon [Power Format Pack](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389) (Version 2017-05-14 ): If you have set a background-color in the class `.field` in your `_editor.css`, this overrides the orange background color that PFP applies in [Markdown Mode](https://github.com/Neftas/supplementary-buttons-anki#using-markdown). If you would like to restore that color you can modify your `_editor.css` as follows:

```
/* applies to all fields that are not in markdown mode */
.field:not(.mdstyle){
    /* place your custom field background color here: */
    background-color: #F5F6CE ! important;
}

/* applies to all fields in markdown mode */
.mdstyle {
    /* The default color PFP uses is #FFEDD3 */
    background-color: #FFEDD3 ! important;
}
```

Compatibility with future versions of Night Mode and Power Format Pack is not guaranteed. No further updates of this addon are planned.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-23 – Initial 2.1 compatibility
2017-08-04 – Initial release

## editor_field_history: Editor Field History

Improves Anki's *Add Notes* dialog with the following features:

- hotkeys that **copy** over tags and field **values of the last note** in the same deck
- a **searchable history window** that provides a list of last used values for the current field

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**USAGE**

`Ctrl + Alt + H` (Win/Linux) or `Cmd + O` (macOS) – Invoke history window
`Alt+Z` – Copy over current field from last note
`Alt+Shift+Z` – Copy over a a number of user-defined fields (see below)
`Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Z` (Win/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + Shift + Z` (macOS) – Copy over all fields

**CONFIGURATION**

You can edit the add-on's source code to modify the following:

`history_window_shortcut`: controls the hotkey for invoking the history window

## editor_field_navigation: Quick Field Navigation Add-on for Anki

Implements shortcuts that allow you to **navigate** through your **fields** in the card **editor**.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**USAGE**

The following shortcuts are provided:

`Ctrl` + `1-9`: Switch focus to field 1-9
`Ctrl` + `0`: Switch focus to last field
`Alt` + `Shift` + `F`: Switch focus back to note fields from tag field (to complement Anki's inbuilt Ctrl + Shift + T) hotkey to switch to the tags field)

Note: In their current implementation the hotkeys will not work when the tag suggestions drop-down box is active. I am [still looking for a fix for this](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/4725-dd-on-development-unable-to-switch-editor-focus-back-to-web-view-when-tags-completer-is-active).

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Adjustments for hidden fields used by add-ons such as Image Occlusion Enhanced
2016-04-19 – Reworked the add-on from scratch to have a much leaner footprint
2015-09-04 – Initial release

------------------------------------------

## editor_indentation_formatter: Indent and Outdent Paragraphs

Introduces two new buttons to the editor toolbar that allow you to **change the indentation of the current paragraph**. This add-on uses `<p>` elements instead of the `<blockquote>`s found in add-ons such as the Power Format Pack which should result in a more readable HTML source code.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Config option that controls whether to use existing tags or not
2017-05-13 – Ability to indent arbitrary tags. More config options (check the source-code header for more information)

------------------------------------------

## editor_random_list: Insert Randomized Lists

Allows you to insert **randomized lists** into your notes.

**DOCUMENTATION**

The add-on requires a custom note type to work properly. Please consult the [README](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/tree/master/src/editor_random_list) for more information on its set-up. The add-on's use is also detailed on that page.

The lists generated by this add-on should be compatible with Anki and AnkiDroid. I have not tested this with AnkiWeb or AnkiMobile.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Update license

------------------------------------------

## editor_sync_cursor_position: Sync Cursor Between Fields and HTML Editor

Preserves the **cursor position** when switching back and forth between the **note editor** and **HTML editing window** (`CTRL+SHIFT+X`). Also improves the readability of the HTML code by introducing new lines between specific tags (`div`, `p`, etc.).

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**INTER-ADD-ON COMPATIBILITY**

Some add-ons like the the [Power Format Pack](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389) overwrite the same functions as this add-on. This doesn't pose an issue as long as *Sync Cursor Position* is loaded last. In case of the Power Format Pack add-on, the fact that *Sync Cursor Position* starts with an "S" should ensure that the latter is loaded after the former, but for some reason that's not always the case. If you do end up experiencing compatibility issues like this, you could try renaming the add-on, e.g. by prepending it with a "z" or a special character like "#".

**CONFIGURATION**

You can modify the add-ons behaviour and appearnce by adjusting its source code. Specifically you can set the following variables:

`DIALOG_SIZE` – Allows you to configure custom source code window dimension

`COSMETIC_NEWLINES` – Whether or not to introduce cosmetic newlines between certain HTML tags in order to improve readability. Disabled by default due to issues with AnkiDroid.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-09-06 – Disable cosmetic newlines by default and make them user-controllable. These were causing issues with AnkiDroid. Thanks to @waldens on GitHub for the report.
2017-08-06 – Update license
2017-05-13 – Increase default window size (the size can also be adjusted in the config section of the source code now). Various smaller bugfixes.

------------------------------------------

## editor_tag_hotkeys: Editor Tag Hotkeys Add-on for Anki

Allows you to define **hotkeys** that **toggle specific tags** in the note **editor**.

**VIDEO TUTORIAL**

The customization and use of this add-on is demonstrated in the following video (alongside other similar add-ons):

[![YouTube: Anki Add-on Guide: Time-Efficient Tagging](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FjWkWEA2Ug/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2FjWkWEA2Ug)

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**USAGE**

-- *Adding a Tag Hotkey* --

Edit `editor-tag.hotkeys.py` and modify the `tags` dictionary with your custom hotkey assignments, e.g.:

    tags = {
        "Alt+Shift+1": u"Anatomy",
        "Alt+Shift+2": u"Physiology"
    }

Supported keyboard modifiers are: `Alt`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Meta` (on Mac: `Meta` ≙ Control, `Ctrl` ≙ Cmd). The exact syntax is explained in the comments next to the dictionary.

-- *Clearing Tags Field* --

This add-on also includes a hotkey that clears the tags field: <code>Alt</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>R</code>

-- *Defining a Unique Tag* --

Sometimes you might want to quickly toggle between several different tags. For this purpose I've implemented a configuration option called unique_tags. Any items added to this list will cause their respective hotkeys to delete all other instances of unique tags aside from the one currently being triggered. 

For instance, if you set up hotkeys for "tag1" and "tag2" and add these tags to `unique_tags`, hitting the hotkey for "tag1" will delete "tag2" from the tags list and vice-versa.

To add a unique tag, simply update the following excerpt in the script:

    unique_tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]

Please make sure to preserve the formatting and quoting while doing so!

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-05 – Update license
2017-04-11 – Reworked add-on from the ground-up: much more intuitive key assignments, preparations for Anki 2.1
2016-02-18 – Add support for unique tags; Misc bug fixes and improvements
2015-12-25 – Add support for unicode in toggled tags (thanks to aleksejrs)
2015-11-06 – Toggling tags also works in the card browser now
2015-10-27 – Added a hotkey to clear the tags field
2015-10-27 – Initial release

------------------------------------------

## main_fullscreen: Toggle Fullscreen Extended

Extends Damien Elmes' original version of the Toggle Fullscreen add-on with the following new features:

- **Hide menu bar** when going into full-screen in order create a distraction-free learning environment
- Add the ability to **define a custom key binding** (default: `F11`) 

In contrast to the original there is no menu entry for this add-on. It would not make sense to have one since the menu bar is hidden in fullscreen mode. Instead you will have to use the hotkey to toggle between the add-on's states.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x.

## overview_deck_switcher: Switch Between Decks on the Main Screen

Adds the following hotkeys to Anki's main deck browser screen:

`Ctrl + Tab`: **Switch** to **next deck**
`Ctrl + Shift + Tab`: **Switch** to **previous deck**

These also work in the detailed view of each deck and in the reviewer.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**CONFIGURATION**

By default the hotkeys will skip decks that don't have any cards that are due or new. Filtered decks and custom study sessions are also ignored. You can change this by editing the add-on and setting the variables defined in the USER CONFIGURATION section at the top.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Refactored code

## overview_refresh_media: Refresh Media References

Adds an entry in the **Tools menu** that **clears the webview cache** (hotkey: `Ctrl+Alt+M`). This will effectively refresh all media files used by your cards and templates, allowing you to display changes to external files without having to restart Anki.

The add-on will also update the modification time of your media collection which will force an upload of any updated files on the next synchronization with AnkiWeb.

Note: Might lead to increased memory consumption if used excessively

## reviewer_hide_toolbar: Hide Toolbar in Reviewer

The aim of the addon is to **free up** some **vertical screen space** while **reviewing** cards.

This is a slightly modified re-upload of an add-on by [Steve AW](https://github.com/steveaw/anki_addons). Below follow excerpts of the original description: 

==========

**RATIONALE**

For me this is useful as I have many cards that contain diagrams which can be fairly large. In addition. modern wide screen displays seem to feel more cramped vertically than horizontally.

The toolbar is made visible again when viewing decks and the overview.

The commands that are usually found on the toolbar are added to a new main window "Toolbar" menu. Shortcut keys should continue to function.

==========

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Update license
2016-04-03 – Use internationalization for toolbar items (thanks to comment below)

**SUPPORT**

Please **do not report issues or bugs in the review section below**, as I will not be able to reply to them nor help you.

## reviewer_hint_hotkeys: Hint Hotkeys

Adds two **hotkeys** to the **reviewer**: 'H' to **reveal hints** one by one, 'G' to reveal all hints at once. Both hotkeys can be customized at the top of the add-on's source code.

This add-on is an updated version of [Hint-peeking Keyboard Bindings](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2616209911) by Ben Lickly. All credit for the original idea goes to him.

## reviewer_more_answer_buttons: More Answer Buttons for New Cards

Adds **extra buttons** to the Reviewer **for new cards** and **cards in learning**.

This is a slightly modified re-upload of an add-on by [Steve AW](https://github.com/steveaw/anki_addons). Below follow excerpts of the original description: 

==========

**SCREENSHOT**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/master/screenshots/reviewer_more_answer_buttons.png)

**DESCRIPTION**

Adds anywhere between 1 to 4 new buttons to the review window when reviewing a new card or cards that are in learning mode. The new buttons function like the existing "Easy" button, but in addition, they reschedule the card to a different interval, which is randomly assigned between a lower and upper limit that is preset by the user (see below).

By default 3 buttons are added, with intervals: "3-4d" , "5-7d" , "8-15d". This can be changed in the source code.

**USE CASE**

I wanted this addon because many of my new cards do not need to be "Learned" as I created and added them myself, typically an hour or so before my first review session. I often add around 100-200 new cards per day, all on a related topic, and this addon allows me to spread the next review of the new cards that don't need learning out in time.

**HOW IT WORKS**

This add-on functions as if you click the "Easy" button on a new card, and then go to the browser and reschedule the card. This means that, in contrast to rescheduling the card, using one of the new answer keys will actually add a new entry to the card review history.

**INTER-ADD-ON COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on is oncompatbile with any other add-ons that also overwrite the `Reviewer._answerButtons` function, i.e. add-ons that also modify the answer button area.

**CONFIGURATION**

Open the add-on in a text editor of your choice and find the `extra_buttons` section below the header. This is a list of dicts, where each item of the list (a dict) is the data for a new button. This can be edited to suit, but **there can not be more than 4 buttons**. Values:

- Description ... appears above the button
- Label ... the label of the button
- ShortCut ... the shortcut key for the button
- ReschedMin ... same as the lower number in the Browser's "Edit/Reschedule" command
- ReschedMax ... same as the higher number in the Browser's "Edit/Reschedule" command

**VIDEO TUTORIAL**

The customization and use of the Progress Bar add-on is demonstrated in the following video (alongside other similar add-ons):

[![YouTube: Anki add-on guide: Gamify Your Reviews](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkveLkAgXiM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UkveLkAgXiM)

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**BEHAVIOR**

The bar can't be seen from the list of decks. It opens in a deck's overview page, and, by default, the bar goal for a session is the total new, lapsed, and due cards in the deck at that point. Upon completion, the bar remains full as you're taken to the deck's overview state. If you leave the review state otherwise, the bar resets.

**CONFIGURATION**

By making small changes at the top of the add-on's source code, you can change the colors, make the corners more rounded, decide whether to  see the percentage (e.g., "50%"), or alter the bar's orientation (horizontal or vertical), location (which of the window's four sides), and direction (which way it moves).

The configuration section will also allow you to customize how your card tally is calculated. By default, both new cards, cards in learning, and review cards are factored in. Each of these queues can be individually toggled off by setting its respective variable to `False` at the top of the config section.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-23 – Limit to daily review limits by default (thanks to Sebastien Guillemot)
             New setting that shows remaining count (thanks to Sebastien Guillemot)
             Bug fixes and smaller improvements (thanks to Sebastien Guillemot)
             Initial 2.1 compatibility
2017-08-06 – Rework configuration section, add options for width and new/review queue
2017-06-15 – Re-upload

**CREDITS AND LICENSE**

This is a fork of an add-on which was removed from AnkiWeb in early 2017. The original was most likely written by nest0r/Ja-Dark who [apparently deleted all of their shared Anki resources](https://forum.koohii.com/thread-14570.html). There is no way to tell for sure since the original add-on description did not contain a copyright notice or attribution to a specific author.

## reviewer_puppy_reinforcement: Puppy Reinforcement

Uses **intermittent reinforcement** with **cute puppies** to encourage card review streaks.

Based on [Show Cute Dogs](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1125592690) by Michael Bertolacci.

**SCREENSHOT**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/master/screenshots/reviewer_puppy_reinforcement.png)

**VIDEO TUTORIAL**

The customization and use of the Puppy Reinforcement add-on is demonstrated in the following video (alongside other similar add-ons):

[![YouTube: Anki add-on guide: Gamify Your Reviews](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkveLkAgXiM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UkveLkAgXiM)

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x ≥ 2.0.30). The 2.1 beta branch is **not supported** at this point in time.

**DIFFERENCES FROM THE ORIGINAL**

- Uses tooltips instead of a separate window
- The puppies are spread intermittently through your reviews. By default they will appear around every 10 cards (some take longer than others). You can customize this by editing the add-on)
- Customizable encouragement messages that change based on the card tally
- Removed cats and other non-puppies

**OTHER NOTES**

- The add-on comes with around 50 puppies by default, but you can add more by placing additional images in the puppy_reinforcement folder next to the add-on
- the tooltip will appear slightly higher than tooltips in Anki usually do. This is to prevent overlapping with other tooltips (e.g. the ones produced by the answer confirmation add-on)

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-08 – New options: duration, image size, card limits (thanks to Lucas on YT for the ideas)
2017-08-06 – Update license
2016-11-18 – Initial release

## sched_advanced_newcard_limits: Limit New Cards to Less Than One

Allows you to restrict the **number of new cards** for specific decks to **less than one per day**.

**CONFIGURATION**

Please edit the configuration section at the top of the source code to define the card limits. The syntax for setting up limits for a specific deck is as follows:

    deck_limits = {
        u"My deck name": 3
    }

where "3" corresponds to one new card every three days.

These settings will only apply to decks that have their new card limit set to "1" within Anki, so please make sure to do so before using this add-on.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**SUPPORTED PLATFORMS**

Like all add-ons that modify scheduling this add-on will only work on the desktop releases.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-06 – Update license
2017-04-11 – Initial release

Adds a new **parameter** to Anki's **search interface** that allows you to **find notes by their last modification date**. 

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**.

## stats_true_retention_extended: True Retention by Card Maturity

This is a slightly modified version of the [True Retention add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/613684242) by Strider that breaks the **retention statistics** up **by card maturity**:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/master/screenshots/stats_true_retention_extended.png)

In addition to this, the add-on also allows you to define a custom card maturity threshold (`MATURE_IVL` at the top of the source code). This is set to 21 days by default.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**.

**CREDITS AND LICENSE**

All credit for the original True Retention add-on goes to Strider. This modified version is based on a [post on the Anki support forums](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/8986-true-retention-how-to-change-value-of-mature-cards-extracted-from-21-to-90-days) by peter19220.

I wasn't able to find any licensing information for the original add-on, but since it reuses parts of Anki's code I think it's fair to assume that it's licensed under the same license as Anki itself (GNU AGPLv3).

- disables initial suggestion box popup when entering the field
- allows using ↑/↓ to invoke the tag suggestion box

## tagedit_subtag_completer: Substring Tag Completion

Allows for **substring matching** in the **tag entry field**, either as full-text matches or limited to tag boundaries defined by the **Hierarchical Tags** add-on.

**COMPATIBILITY**

Initial tests have shown this add-on to both work on Anki 2.0.x and Anki 2.1.x. However, as the Anki 2.1.x line of releases is still in beta, I cannot provide any kind of official support for this platform. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/issues).

**CONFIGURATION**

A number of settings may be customized in the add-ons source code:

`LIMIT_TO_HIERARCHY`: Whether the add-on should only match tag segments defined by the Hierarchical Tags add-on
`HIERARCHICHAL_DELIMITER`: Tag delimiter used for option above
`HIGHLIGHT_WORKAROUND`: Enabled by default to solve a Qt bug that appears on Anki 2.0.x with some Linux distributions. The suggestions popup might look better with this option disabled on platforms that do not suffer from this bug.

**CHANGELOG**

2017-08-23 – Initial release
